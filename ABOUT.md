What is the programming language used here & Why?

This site built using PHP7. Why? Mainly because it results in faster site loading speeds since it runs in its own memory space, also 
it has a huge comunity, which is very useful for any developer. Also it is the most suggested language that i'm familiar with.   

New things learned in this task:
 
1-Heroku, this is the first time i deal with heroku, so i had to go through it from scratch.
2-Github, this is the first time i deal with Github, so i had to go through it from scratch as well.
  

Issues: 

Mainly the issues were related to the CSS and Styling part, since i'm a backend engineer usual i don't have to take care of the CSS.
